## Technologies  
- Java   

## Description  
This project consists of creating a game similar to **Rogue** ([Roguelike on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike))

### Key Features:  
- A strategy-based game
- The player controls a **hero** who moves **one step at a time**  
- For every movement made by the hero, the enemies also move. They move randomly unless a certain distance of the hero, then they chase him  
- The hero cannot walk through walls and progresses through multiple rooms. He can attack the enemies by overlapping their position or by using weapons
- Multiple enemies exist with the same movement ability as the hero, except the Thief that inherits the movement of a bishop
